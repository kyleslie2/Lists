## Clothing
Always looking for nice clothes. I don't buy them for myself often, so I'm always excited to receive them as gifts!

Criteria:
 - Good fit
 - Good for work
 - Comfortable
 
 Sizes: 
  - medium + slim fit for button ups
  - medium for t-shirts
  - Dress shirts: Calvin Klein Extreme slim 15, 34, 35 fit well a couple years ago (might be small in neck and shoulders now)

Do need: 
  - Nice, comfortable button-ups and dressy sweaters for work 
   - Ex: Frank and Oak medium slim fit flannel dress-shirt (dark green) todo: <insert link to picture?>

## Food and Drink
Coffee and alcohol are always fun! And no clutter!

Coffee:
 - Whole beans (not ground)
 - Something I haven't tried before
 
 Alcohol (Help us slowwwwwwly stock our liquor cabinet!):
  - Any nice bottle of liquor we probably don't have (Hint: we don't have much haha)
  - Fun beer I might not have tried (Note: any type is fine *except sour beer*)
  - Wine: Always fun to try a new bottle together!
  
 Hotsauce (always like trying new, tasty hot-sauces):
 - *Tasty > painful!* Interesting flavours and medium heat is more enjoyable than pure pain!
 - Citrusy, fruity sauces with medium - high heat are fun
 
 Restaurants:
  - Restaurant gift-cards for brunch spots or dinner places are fun! Alicia and I love to go out to eat!
  
 
  

## Bags
I love really nice backpacks and messenger bags/ sachels but don't have the money for them. Although I am picky about what I like when it comes to the style and quality of the bag :p

Criteria:
  - Comfortable strap
  - Sleek design
  - Functional size (not too big or too small (holds my laptop + lunch + some pens/notebook)
  - Neutral colours (no orange or pink please haha)

## Tech
Tech gadgets and accessories I would love to get but don't _need_

## Stuff for Eugene
Eugene can never have enough toys or supplies and if Eugene is happy, I'm happy 

Toys:
  - Anything squeaky or ball-shaped is a win for him 
     - he plays with them in the apartment, not outside
     - he likes fake-chasing it around the apartment and then sitting there squeaking it over and over, pretending he's killing bunnies...
  - Anything squirrel-like
  - Ideally somewhat durable
  - He enjoys chew-toys like the antler we bought him

Treats:
  - All treats are good  

Misc:
  - Clothing (indoor or outdoor), petsmart/ dog store gift-cards 

## Practical
Things I can always use but might not buy myself
 
 Gift cards:
  - Amazon
  - Google Play (can be used for other in-app purchases like uber and lyft too)
  - Visa
  - Uber/ Uber-eats
  - Restaurants
  - LCBO
  - Startbucks

## Miscellaneous
Random things currently on my personal "To Buy" list (updated: *November 7th, 2019*):
